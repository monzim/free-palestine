# Free Palestine

## Introduction

This is a open source project that aims to show the current situations in Gaza. Anyone from any where in the world can upload image here. And it will be publicly available for everyone to see. BUT WE WILL ONLY ALLOW GAZA AND PALESTINE RELATED IMAGES. This repo is open for contribution. You can contribute to this project by adding new features, fixing bugs, improving documentation, and more.

## How to Run locally

First, run the development server:

```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
